# Updates Made: Added "Need Help?" Contact Buttons

## Changes Summary

I've added two prominent call-to-action buttons that link to your contact page (https://www.zqwcpa.com/#contact):

### 1. Header Button
**Location:** Below the main title "Business Filing Tracker"
**Design:** 
- Indigo button with help icon
- Text: "Need Help? Contact Us"
- Always visible at the top of the page

### 2. Footer Call-to-Action Section
**Location:** At the bottom of the page (appears after user selects entity type)
**Design:**
- Large gradient banner (indigo to purple)
- Heading: "Need Professional Guidance?"
- Description about ZQW CPA & Advisory services
- Large button: "Schedule a Consultation"
- Professional, eye-catching design

## Marketing Benefits

✅ **Lead Generation** - Converts tool users into potential clients
✅ **Professional Positioning** - Shows you provide both tools AND expert services
✅ **Clear Call-to-Action** - Easy path for users who need help
✅ **Value Demonstration** - Free tool builds trust, CTA captures leads

## Files Updated

1. **filing-tracker.html** - Standalone HTML version (ready to upload)
2. **business-filing-tracker.jsx** - React component version

Both files now include:
- Header contact button
- Footer consultation CTA section
- Links direct to: https://www.zqwcpa.com/#contact

## Next Steps

1. Upload the updated `filing-tracker.html` to your hosting
2. If already hosted, replace the old file with the new one
3. Test both buttons to ensure they link correctly to your contact section

## Customization Options

You can easily modify:
- Button text (e.g., "Get Expert Help", "Talk to a CPA")
- Button colors (change `bg-indigo-600` to match your brand)
- CTA message in the footer
- Link destination (currently goes to contact section)

## A/B Testing Ideas

Consider testing different approaches:
- "Free Consultation" vs "Schedule a Consultation"
- "Contact Our Team" vs "Talk to a Tax Expert"
- Different button placements or colors
- Track which CTA generates more contacts
